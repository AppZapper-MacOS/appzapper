## What is AppZapper?  

AppZapper Mac is a **dedicated uninstallation utility** created to erase apps and the hidden files they leave behind. When you delete software through Finder, most of the time, preference files, caches, and fragments remain on your Mac. These leftovers accumulate and can affect performance. AppZapper eliminates this problem by identifying all related files and deleting them at once.  

The strength of AppZapper lies in its **intuitive design**. No need to dig through folders or guess which files belong to which program. Just drag an application into AppZapper, and it instantly scans for all connected items. You’ll see a list of what it found, and with one click, your system is clean of that software.  

This tool is ideal for users who want to:  
- Keep their MacBook storage free of unnecessary clutter.  
- Regularly test and uninstall applications without leaving traces.  
- Maintain peak macOS performance by preventing hidden files from piling up.  
- Simplify maintenance without using complex system cleaners.  

AppZapper is also a favorite among **developers and IT professionals**. When testing multiple apps or managing office computers, quick and complete removal helps keep systems consistent and reliable. Students and everyday Mac users also appreciate how AppZapper saves space and prevents slowdowns with minimal effort.  

The app is built for **modern macOS systems**, running smoothly on both Intel-based Macs and Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3). It’s extremely lightweight, consumes very little memory, and works in the background without affecting performance.
